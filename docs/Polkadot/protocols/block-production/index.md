The Polkadot relay chain is built by validators through a proof-of-stake (PoS) block production mechanism. At present, it operates with a hybrid system that combines BABE and Aura. The plan is to eventually replace this with Sassafras.

**BABE:** A proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol provides a mechanism for electing validators to produce blocks in designated time slots. BABE's election is based on a verifiable random function (VRF), originally introduced by David et al. in [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf). Specifically, a validator is elligible to produce a block if its VRF output falls below a pre-defined threshold. As a result, a round may yield one, multiple, or no elected validators. This election mechanism is completely private. Until an elected validator publishes a block, no one can know who was selected. Such privacy property is crucial for blockchain security, as it provides resilience against adaptive adversaries capable of corrupting validators at any time. 

One limitation of BABE's approach is that blocks may not be produced for extended periods if no validator meets the threshold. These empty slots degrade throughput and create uneven performance. To mitigate this, empty slots are filled using blocks generated by validators deterministically selected by [Aura](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1079.pdf). This ensures that the chain continues producing blocks during otherwise idle slots, but it comes at a tradeoff. Aura's selection process is not private, making it vulnerable to adaptive adversaries. For instance, knowing in advance which validator will be chosen allows an attacker to launch targeted denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to block publication. Relying solely on Aura is unsuitable under adaptive adversarial conditions. Nevertheless, the BABE+Aura hybrid protocol remains secure and live under such model, since overall security relies on BABE. The only drawback is that empty slots are not prevented in theory, meaning throughput improvements are limited in the adaptive adversarial setting.

**Sassafras:** Sassafras aims to achieve both security and non-empty slot property on the relay chain under an adaptive adversarial model. Its election mechanism is built on a novel primitive called 'ring-VRF.' Like standard VRFs, ring-VRF provides randomness and output verifiability, but it also allows verification without requiring knowledge of the public key of the validator who generated the output. 

In essence, all validators generate a sufficient number of ring VRF outputs. These outputs are then verified and sorted to determine the validator order for block production. Becasue ring-VRF outputs do not disclose the validator's identity during verification, the mechanism preserves privacy. Sassafras limits block production to a **single** validator per time interval. This approach reduces the likelihood of forks, thereby improving parachain performance.
