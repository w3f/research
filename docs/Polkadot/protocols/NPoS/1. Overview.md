title: Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) Overview
---

![](NPoS_Cover.png)

In this entry, we introduce Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS), a relatively new scheme that the Polkadot blockchain implements to select validators eligible to participate in its consensus protocol. We also offer a glimpse into the research conducted by the Web3 Foundation and explain the distinctive mechanism by which validators are elected.

## Validators and nominators

**Validators** are entities that play a vital role in blockchain operation and development. Approximately once per day, the system elects a group of validators who, over the next several hours, participate in highly sensitive protocols such as [block production](Polkadot/protocols/block-production/index.md) and the [GRANDPA finality gadget](Polkadot/protocols/finality.md). 

In this demanding role, validators run resource-intesive operations, maintain high communication responsiveness, and build a long-term reputation for reliability. They must also stake DOTs, Polkadot‚Äôs native token, as collateral to guarantee good behavior. Validators are well compensated for protocol adherence, but they may be slashed and lose their stake if they act negligently or maliciously. Any node capable of meeting the required standards can publicly offer itself as a validator candidate. For operational efficiency, however, only a limited number of validators can be elected. The current number of validators is in the hundreds, with the potential to scale into the thousands as the number of parachains continues to grow.

Any DOT holder in the system can participate as a **nominator**. Nominators publish a list of validator candidates they trust and stake an amount of DOTs to support them. If any of these candidates are elected as validators, both validators and nominators share rewards or penalties on a per-staked-DOT basis. Unlike validators, an unlimited number of participants can act as nominators. As long as they make informed choices, supporting only candidates with strong security practices, their role carries relatively low risk while offering a steady stream of revenue. The Polkadot network includes other specialized roles, but this section focuses solely on the relationship between validators and nominators.

## The NPoS scheme

The nominator‚Äìvalidator duality offers considerable security guarantees. It enables the selection of validators backed by large aggregate stakes, significantly higher than any single party's DOT holdings, while filtering out low-stake candidates. At any given time, a substantial portion of the total DOT supply is expected to be staked through NPoS. This design makes it extremely difficult for adversarial entities to have validators elected, as building the necessary reputation to gain support is a high barrier. Moreover, any malicious activity would result in large amounts of DOTs being slashed, making attacks extremely costly.

The NPoS scheme is significantly more efficient than proof-of-work (PoW) and faster than traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms. Networks that rely on deterministic finality require a limited validator set, though the size of this set can be adjusted through governance. NPoS enables virtually all DOT holders to participate continuously, thereby enhancing security by increasing the total value at stake and expanding opportunities for individuals to earn a yield based on their holdings.

## The election process

To develop an efficient election process, the Web3 Foundation research team employs a range of tools, from election theory and game theory to discrete optimization. This process aims to deliver fair representation and robust security, and it can be applied to any blockchain utilizing NPoS.

Unlike other PoS-based projects where validators' voting power is proportional to their stake, Polkadot assigns equal voting power to elected validators in the consensus protocol. To support this design, nominators‚Äô stakes should be distributed as evenly as possible among the elected validators, while still respecting nominators‚Äô preferences.

Let‚Äôs explore how the election process unfolds through a few illustrative examples.

**Fair representation.** In the late 19th century, Swedish mathematician Lars Edvard Phragm√©n proposed a method for electing members of parliament. He observed that prevailing election systems tended to allocate all seats to the most popular political party. His approach aimed to ensure that seats were distributed proportionally to the votes each party received, thereby granting greater representation to minorities. 

The principle underlying his method, known as proportional justified representation, is especially well-suited to NPoS elections. It ensures that no pool of nodes is over- or under-represented among the elected validators relative to its stake. The heuristics, built upon Phragm√©n‚Äôs original concept, guarantee that this property holds in every election.

The illustration above represents a typical input to the election process. Nominators on the left hold varying amounts of stake and are connected by lines to trusted validator candidates on the right. In this simplified example, validators do not hold any stake of their own, although they typically do in real-world scenarios.

Now, suppose we elect ùëò = 4 validators. According to the fair representation property, any nominator holding at least one-fourth of the total stake is guaranteed to have at least one of their trusted validators elected. In this example, the total stake is 40 DOTs, so any nominator with at least 10 DOTs is guaranteed representation. Therefore, the first two nominators are assured to have one of their chosen validators elected. The illustration below displays three possible election outcomes: one that violates the fair representation property, and two that satisfy it.

**Security.** If a nominator has two or more of their trusted validators elected, their stake must be distributed among those validators in a way that balances the validators‚Äô backing as evenly as possible. This maximizes resistance to adversarial manipulation, since an adversarial pool can only elect a validator by securing sufficiently high backing.

For this reason, we define the security level of an election result as the minimum backing received by any elected validator. For the last two election outcomes with fair representation, we provide stake distributions that demonstrate security levels of 6 and 9, respectively.

The election result on the right achieves a higher security level by distributing the nominators‚Äô stake more evenly across validators, resulting in backings of roughly equal size. The objective of the NPoS election process is to produce an outcome that ensures fair representation and maximizes security, an optimization challenge that is [NP-complete](https://www.britannica.com/science/NP-complete-problem). To address this complexity, the Web3 Foundation research team has developed fast, approximate heuristics with strong guarantees on both security and scalability.

The technical advancements introduced by Polkadot, and the opportunities unlocked by NPoS and other highly efficient blockchain mechanisms, are significant, paving the way for innovative new projects.
