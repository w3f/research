# Research at Web3 Foundation

Web3 Foundation Research is being done in an in-house research team as well as in collaboration with various projects and research groups. The in-house team is mostly located in Zug, Switzerland.

Our research generally focuses on areas of:  
- Decentralised algorithms: consensus, optimization, game theory  
- Cryptography  
- Networking  

We analyze existing protocols, come up with new ones and specify them. We work closely with development teams to make sure our work is practical and useful in context of Web3 technologies.

Some of our current initiatives:  
- [Polkadot network protocol research](polkadot)  
- [Messaging for Web3 initiative](https://github.com/w3f/messaging)  

Talk to us on Riot at #w3f:matrix.org or on our [forum](https://forum.web3.foundation/).
