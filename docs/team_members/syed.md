Seyed is a researcher at the Web3 Foundation, where he works on the specification of the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE). 

**Research Areas.** Seyed investigates ways to improve or simplify the primitives of the Polkadot Runtime Environment (PRE) and contributes to the implementation of various algebraic and cryptographic components.

**Short Bio**. As a mathematician pursuing his Ph.D., Seyed focused on curve-based cryptography, particularly geometric structures that offer richer mathematical properties than elliptic curves. He studied and designed provably secure messaging protocols and contributed to the development of various machine learningâ€“based attack mitigation and analysis techniques, network protocols, and distributed and cooperative network solutions.
