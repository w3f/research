Jeff Burdges is an applied cryptography researcher at the Web3 Foundation, where he focuses on cryptographic solutions for decentralized and privacy-preserving protocols. 

**Research Areas.** Jeff's work includes collaborative randomness, specialized signature schemes such as verifiable random functions (VRFs) or anonymous credentials, as well as increasing exploration into zero-knowledge proofs and incentive or mechanism design using VRFs. He also researches peer-to-peer private messaging systems that utilize mix networks.

Jeff occasionally discovers vulnerabilities, most recently in the BIP32-Ed25519 proposal, and previously in blind signature deployments and mix network designs, including broad limitations in post-quantum key exchanges suitable for mix networks.

**Short Bio.**  Jeff previously worked on [Taler](https://taler.net/en/) and [GNUNet](https://gnunet.org/en/) as a postdoctoral researcher under Christian Grothoff at Inria in Rennes, France. His contributions focused on anonymity protocols, including mix networks, blind signatures, security proofs, distributed authentication, forward-secure ratchets, and pairing-based protocols. Jeff holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Rutgers University in New Jersey.
