Jonas has joined the team of the Web3 Foundation at the beginning of July 2020 as a research scientist, where he focuses on economic questions regarding the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. In particular, he analyzes and optimizes the interplay between human behavior and the protocol. By doing so, he applied insights from Psychology and Behavioral Economics. For his studies, he uses empirical and experimental data.

**Short Biography**:  Before joining W3F, Jonas earned his Ph.D. in Behavioral and Experimental Economics from the University of Bern, where he investigated human behavior in markets and organizations. Before that, he obtained an MSc degree in Quantitative Economics at the University of Konstanz.
