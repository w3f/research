**Tasks in Web3 Foundation:**

* Designing security models for the protocols in Polkadot
* Protocol construction and formal security analysis/proofs

Some protocols in Polkadot that I work:  block production mechanism of relay chains (BABE), availability and validity and bridges.

**Research Areas:**

* Provable security for blockchain technologies and interoperability
* Distance bounding protocols, secure positioning
* Fair exchange protocols

**Short Biography:**

I joined the Web3 Foundation as a research scientist at the end of 2018. Before W3F, I obtained my Ph.D. from Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in the group named [LASEC](https://lasec.epfl.ch/) under supervision of Prof. Serge Vaudenay. My Ph.D. thesis titled ''Implications of Position in Cryptography'' focuses on designing security models and constructing/analyzing protocols for position-based cryptography (e.g., distance bounding protocols, proof of position and secure positioning). I earned my M$.$Sc. degree in Computer Sciences and Engineering from Koç University in 2014 in [CRYPTO@KU](https://crypto.ku.edu.tr/) group, under the supervision of Assoc. Prof, Alptekin Küpçü. My research in master studies focuses on secure and fair multi-two party computation and exchange protocols. I obtained two B$.$Sc. degrees in Mathematics and also Computer Engineering from TOBB University of Economics and Technology in 2012.
