	abstract="We propose a new unified point compression format for Edwards, Twisted Edwards and Montgomery curves over large-characteristic fields, which effectively divides the curve's cofactor by 4 at very little cost to performance. This allows cofactor-4 curves to efficiently implement prime-order groups.",
